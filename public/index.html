      content="LHW is a local history webapp. It is made for those who would like to be able to search a location for
               historical facts, and to be able to see those facts pinned on a map. It is great for those travelors that love 
               the history of the areas that they visit. As a new project with few contributors it will take some time to add facts
               to this website, but over time, I hope for this to be a place where you can search for any city in the united
               states of america, and to be able to read little known historical facts about the area. "

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
