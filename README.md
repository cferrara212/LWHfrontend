<h1>This is the Local History Webapp React Frontend.</h1> 

<h3>#Purpose</h3>

The application is a local history application. The purpose of this 
application is to give individuals who may like to travel to new locations 
and explore the local history a place to do so. In this application the users 
will be able to search for a location and get an overview of a location with 
a list of little known historical facts in the area. If the historical fact 
happened in a specific location, or has a location still existing, it will have 
a map with a marker for that location. The app also allows contributors to make 
accounts, so that they can add little known historical facts for their own areas.
