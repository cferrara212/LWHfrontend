//please do not abuse this API key...I have left this here to show you how to turn your api key into a variable that can be
// transferred into your main file for use with your map. You should have your own API key, which you can easily obtain from 
// your account page in MapBox. Also remember, any information transpiled through reactapp can be accessed in some way or another
// on the client side, so If you want your api key to be a secret, you would need to create a backend storage container, and 
// then pull it from there.
